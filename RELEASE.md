# Versioned container releases

The `Publish versioned containers` workflow builds from reviewed `main` source,
tests the native container against disposable local services, then publishes
seven Linux architectures to `ghcr.io/electronlsr/trojan-panel-ui`.

Release tags are explicit in `.release-version` (initial release `2026.10.05`).
The workflow refuses to replace an existing version tag and also publishes an
exact `sha-<source-commit>` tag. There is no floating `latest` tag. Consumers
should pin the multi-platform digest recorded in the `release-image` artifact.
The runtime base image is pinned by digest; toolchains and dependency lockfiles
are fixed. SBOM/provenance and OCI source/revision/version labels are included.
The original Alpine/Nginx runtime generation is deliberately retained for
compatibility; this is not a claim that legacy runtimes/dependencies are free of
known vulnerabilities or that all architectures received native execution tests.

Publishing uses only GitHub's per-job `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write` in
the final publish job. No long-lived token, production secret, or deployment
credential is stored. PRs cannot enter the publish workflow. The workflow runs
on an explicit release-version/build recipe change on `main` or a manual run
of `main`; tests and cross-compilation must finish first. Repository writers
must bump `.release-version` for each new release.

First publication may create a private GHCR package. Set only this package's
visibility to Public in GitHub's package settings, then verify its manifest and
pull without credentials before distributing an installer. A successful push
alone is not proof of public availability. No server is deployed by this repo.

Runtime paths, environment names, ports, and installer bind-mount conventions
remain unchanged. Native service smoke tests use a new disposable Docker
network, randomized database credentials, and disposable containers only.

The UI build uses Node 22.20.0 and frozen Yarn dependencies. The inherited
Vue CLI IPC helper declares an obsolete Node <=17 engine range; installation
ignores that metadata range, without changing its locked bytes. Runtime-adapter,
subscription, production build and container checks still gate publication.
Node is a build tool only and is not shipped in the Nginx runtime image.
